It's making me embarrassed
When I see you I feel embarrassed
My routine has these stops
You are shy not to laugh
Aah, this girl is a mystery
Sorry cat, mystery girl
She can't take me seriously
But she gets lost in my sex life
Sorry baby if one day I hurt you
It's just that her way, he doesn't get out of my mind
Say how many times for you I already cried
That our bodies feel something very different
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more, more
I want you come to the father
Father, father, father, father
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more
I want you come to the father
Father, father, father, father
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more
I want you come to the father
Father, father, father, um
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more
I want you come to me
Me
Tell me your secret here in my ear
To the neighbor of the apartment don't wake up
Then I show you, I prove the gift of the boy
My neighbor will have to listen
I needed a therapy
And I don't know what my medicine will be
Transport more bitch has to come from gringa
It's so much woman who can fill a building
Each letter does not deal that I sent you in the past
The forgotten flowers still inside my car
Sometimes I ran away today I'm dating
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I'm teaching new millionaire
The artist's life is making me tired
And for relationship is a little complicated
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sorry baby if I ever hurt you
Is that his way he does not leave my mind
But how many times for you I already cried
That our bodies feel something very different
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more, more
I want you come to the father
Father, father, father, father
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more
I want you come to me
Baby
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more
I want you come to the father
Father, father
Today I don't cry anymore
More, more, more, more
I want you come to me
