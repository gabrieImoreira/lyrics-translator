As natural as daylight
But what a laziness good
Leave me here for nothing
Today no one will spoil my day
I will only spend energy to kiss your mouth
Stay with me then
Do not leave me
Has anyone asked you how your day was?
A friendly word, good news
This is missing in everyday life
We never know who these people are
I just wanted to remind you
That that time I couldn't do more for us
I was wrong and you don't have to forgive me
But I also want to show you
That there is a good side in this story
Everything we still have to share
And live
And sing
No matter what the day
Let's live
Bruise
What matters is our joy
Let's live
And sing
No matter what the day
Let's live
Bruise
What matters is our joy
As natural as daylight
But what a laziness good
Leave me here for nothing
Today no one will spoil my day
I will only spend energy to kiss your mouth
I just wanted to remind you
That that time I couldn't do more for us
I was wrong and you don't have to forgive me
But I also want to show you
That there is a good side in this story
Everything we still have to share
And live
And sing
No matter what the day
Let's live
Bruise
What matters is our joy
Let's live
And sing
No matter what the day
Let's live
Bruise
What matters is our joy
As natural as daylight
